description: A collection of photographs that capture what words can’t — stillness, movement, and meaning.

Photography, for me, is a kind of translation. It’s how I hold stillness, memory, and emotion long enough to see what they’re really saying. Each photo captures a pause — a moment that asked me to look closer.

My photos are pieces of how I see — quiet moments that exist between movement and memory. Sometimes they’re stories, sometimes just light, but always a reflection of where I’ve been and what I’ve felt.
