Photography, to me, isn’t just about the image — it’s about presence.  
The quiet before a shutter clicks. The way light lands on stone or skin.  
It’s how I slow time and hold a feeling long enough to understand it.

<p>
My work lives somewhere between emotion and observation — small stories told through composition, shadow, and color.  
Some photos are taken in moments that changed me. Others, in moments that simply made me stop and breathe.  
Either way, each one is a memory made still.
