These projects reflect how I use Figma not just as a design tool, but as a way to think — to map how information, visuals, and purpose connect. Each project blends layout logic with creative storytelling, turning function into form.

<h2>🎯 USC Institute for Creative Technologies Placemat Design</h2>

<p>
This is a placemat design created in Figma in <strong>October 2025</strong> for my work at 
<a href="https://ict.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC Institute for Creative Technologies</a>.  
The design serves as a snapshot of what the Institute does and how it fits within DoD initiatives — summarizing research, partnerships, and mission focus in a clear visual format.

<h2>🥊 USC Boxing Club Website Mock-Up</h2>

<p>
This is a mock-up created in Figma in <strong>September 2023</strong> for the 
<a href="https://www.trojanboxingclub.com/" target="_blank">USC Boxing Club</a>.  
At the time, their page was outdated, so I designed this as a refreshed concept — inspired by modern sports league layouts.  
Looking back now, it’s interesting to see how their new design mirrors many of the same ideas I built into this early prototype.

<p>
Each Figma project is a study in systems — balancing usability, storytelling, and tone.  
From institutional communication to creative redesign, I approach every layout as both narrative and interface.
