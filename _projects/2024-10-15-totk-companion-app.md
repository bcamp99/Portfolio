description: A concept app inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — designed to enhance the streaming and community experience through intuitive UX and storytelling visuals.

<p>
This mock-up design was created in Figma as the first phase of a <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Companion App</em>. It focuses on the streaming experience — where fans could discover live streams, clips, and streamer profiles — all built around clarity, exploration, and immersion.
</p>

<p>
The process began with wireframes, mapping the flow of pages and interactions to ensure usability came first. Once that structure was set, I layered in design: textures, type, and detail that drew from Zelda’s sense of adventure and magic. Every username, thumbnail, and caption was custom-made or generated through plugins to mirror a real-world UI.

## App Flow and Interface

<p>
Once the structure was refined, I built out full mock-ups of the main app views. The goal was to balance familiarity (what users expect from modern streaming apps) with the fantasy world’s unique design energy — soft gradients, gold tones, and subtle motion-inspired elements.

## Reflection

<p>
This project taught me how structure and visual storytelling intersect. Even in a fictional setting, grounding design decisions in real user experience makes the work feel tangible. 
</p>

<p>
Working on this app helped refine my approach to layout consistency, information hierarchy, and accessible color contrast — and reminded me that good design always balances function and feeling.
