### *Ghosts in the Breeze*  
by **BEC**  

My perfume will always remain the same.
Those two perfect scents from Victoria’s Secret.
I wonder, when the breeze blows just right,
do you think you smell me?
Do the memories flood back?

I’m still searching for your scent.
You left nothing in our place that smells like you,
so I find myself wishing the wind will shift just right
so for a moment
I can pretend you’re standing next to me.

In those moments,
we give bodies to each other’s ghosts,
if only for a breath.
Then the breeze changes again,
and we chase it
the leaves bristling in the trees,
the dirt and dust drifting through the air,
every scent moving around us,
trying to shape what’s no longer there
one last time.
