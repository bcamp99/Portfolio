### *Safety Off*  
by **BEC**  

The bittersweet twinge  
That I let the bullet go through me this time.  
I thought I’d been hit before—  
But I’d only ever been grazed.  
Had I known it would shred me inside,  
Maybe I would’ve run.  
But I knew the risks.  

We stood with arms extended,  
Each barrel aimed at the other’s chest,  
Fingers resting on the safety,  
Swearing our love would never wound.  

For years, our arms stayed outstretched,  
The safeties still on—  
But time made our hands tremble.  
We never thought to switch arms,  
To share the burden of holding them up for so long.  

One day, I saw you click yours off.  
I dropped my gun, raised my hands.  
I begged as your finger tightened—  

Please…  
Please…  
You don’t have to do this…  

You whispered,  
I have to… it hurts too much.  
I wish I could keep my arm up,  
Safety on forever—  
But I can’t. I’m tired.  

The shot tore through me.  
I fell,  
You dropped your weapon,  
Staring at me.  

“It aches. I don’t want to feel like this.”  
I closed my eyes.  
You said, “It won’t always feel like this. The wound will heal.”  
But you couldn’t hear me think—  

I never turned my safety off.  
No matter how heavy it got,  
I swore I’d keep it on.  

The wound is too wide now to stitch.  
It will never truly close.  

I only wish you could’ve kept your safety on.
