## Honey Part 1 — October 2022

From the moment I met him he was honey.  
A taste so sweet I had to have more.  
I wanted to pour him into me,  
Like I pour honey into my morning tea.  
He enhanced the flavor of my day,  
Bringing a calm sweeping force over me.  
While I watched the sunrise over the trees,  
I wondered if this honey would ever run empty.

## Honey Part 2 — January 2023

Months earlier I had watched the sunrise over the trees,  
Wondering if the sweetest honey I’d ever tasted would run out.  
Today as I sit writing, the rain pouring down around me,  
I look out at the haze—  
To the naked eye I can see merely feet in front of me,  
But to the mind’s eye I can see far beyond that.  
What I can see is that there is no end in sight.  
His sweetness ebbs and flows but it has yet to run out.  
I no longer worry—  
He is still as sweet as ever,  
And just as he pours into me, I pour into him.

## Honey Part 3 — July 2025

A few years ago, I stood as rain poured down around me,  
Declaring our honey would ebb and flow but never run out—  
That just as I poured into him, he’d pour into me.  
But jars do empty,  
And bees do leave the hive.  

The garden has gone quiet now;  
Stillness is all that remains.  
The flowers have begun to wilt;  
I don’t hear the humming like I used to—  
The bees were once busy at work.  

I thought his sweetness would never run out,  
But a jar cannot be filled when it’s poured into a cracked one.  
I hadn’t noticed at first—  
The slow drip, the quiet loss,  
The jar never refilling,  
The garden never returning to its soft, low hum.  

Until one day I looked back and saw  
Sticky trails leading nowhere,  
And flower petals shriveled on the ground.  

I kept pouring,  
But the honey was already gone,  
And the bees had abandoned the hive.
