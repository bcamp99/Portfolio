Through the haze you reach out for a shadow you swear you saw and just as you begin to grasp onto it, it slips through your fingers, disappearing into the darkness just beyond. This is what it is like reaching for a distant memory deep in the crevices of your mind.  

In Cambodia, the number of people who lived through the Khmer Rouge dwindles each year. Those who remember have pushed it into the far recesses of their minds for various reasons. For some, it is out of guilt for what they did or did not do during this time period. For others, it is to forget unimaginable atrocities, or simply to move forward to live beyond the Khmer Rouge. The people who remember are split between wanting to recognize the atrocities that occurred and wanting to forget this time in Cambodian history altogether.  

Rithy Panh takes on the role of the gatekeeper of the Khmer Rouge, bringing to life the horrors that occurred under their regime. Through his unique use of narrative techniques, he is able to revitalize the memory of a time not long ago where the people of Cambodia were displaced, tortured, and slaughtered under the ruthless Khmer Rouge Regime. Rithy Panh uses these techniques to restore the collective memory of a country and extend the knowledge of their experience under a totalitarian regime that committed genocide beyond Cambodia to the world.

## Recreating Memory Through Film

Rithy Panh uses his ability to make art in the form of documentaries and other films to recreate the memory of the Khmer Rouge regime—but what was this regime? To understand the importance and style Panh uses, we must first take a walk through a painful period of Cambodian history.  

The Khmer Rouge was the nickname given to the Communist Party led by Pol Pot. They came to power when they won the Cambodian Civil War, overthrowing the government and seizing Phnom Penh, the country’s capital. The Khmer Rouge controlled Cambodia from 1975–1979.  

Pol Pot, much like Hitler, had a desire to create a “master race”—this one purely Cambodian. This meant isolating the country from the global community and enacting extreme measures to control the populace. His paranoia about internal threats drove him to put the entire country under scrutiny. Citizens were relocated to the countryside and to “schools,” which were prisons in all but name. Those relocated were worked to the bone, tortured, starved, and killed.  

> “It is better to arrest ten people by mistake than to let one guilty person go free.”  
> — Democratic Kampuchea adage, cited by historian David Chandler

Dehumanization was immediate and total. The most notorious of the prisons created by the regime was S-21. Of the thousands of Cambodians who passed through, only seven survived the horrors that occurred within those walls—one of whom was Rithy Panh.

## The Survivor’s Memory

Taken away from his home at thirteen, Panh’s childhood was stolen. His family died one by one from starvation, exhaustion, or despair. In *Cambodia, a Wound That Will Not Heal*, he wrote:

> “I learned to speak again and to accept what had happened to me. Then I rediscovered my memories, my ability to imagine, to laugh, to dream, to rebuild my life… Some think we should forget and look to the future, that there’s no point in inflicting another ordeal on ourselves by trying to bring back memories and pick over old wounds.”  
> — *Rithy Panh (1999)*

As an exile in France, Panh wanted to forget his past—but filmmaking became the medium through which he could remember, heal, and teach.  

He realized that silence allows the potential for atrocity to return. Forgetting means erasure, and erasure means history can repeat itself. Panh’s work ensures the memory of Cambodia’s genocide endures beyond those who lived through it.

## Narrative as Testimony

Panh’s films—including *S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine*, *Duch*, *Bophana: A Cambodian Tragedy*, and *The Missing Picture*—use narrative to reconstruct Cambodia’s memory through multiple voices.  

In *S21*, survivors and former guards speak, often side by side. Panh recalled, “One of the executioners… only expresses his regrets; he doesn’t feel guilty. He destroyed non-persons.” This lack of remorse forces viewers to grapple with the psychology of cruelty and denial.  

*Duch* (2011) continues this exploration through interviews with Kaing Guek Eav, the leader of S21. As scholar Leslie Barnes observed, Duch’s contradictions reveal how truth and guilt mutate over time—a haunting loop of denial and acknowledgment.  

In *Bophana: A Cambodian Tragedy*, Panh recreates the story of Hout Bophana and Ly Sitha, lovers torn apart by the regime. Their story becomes emblematic of the human cost of totalitarianism. Artist Vann Nath, who survived by painting portraits of Pol Pot, illustrates the trauma of memory through his work—his art acts as a “photo archive” for those without images to show their pain.

## The Missing Picture

In *The Missing Picture*, Panh uses clay figurines and his own narration to reconstruct the childhood stolen from him. As critic Lior Zylberman wrote:

> “The models made out of clay are still, motionless… yet the camera moves around them, bringing life to the inanimate. The story being told helps us combine all the elements so that what is in our imagination comes to life.”  

This film is both remembrance and resistance—a way of confronting trauma by giving it shape, color, and motion.

## The Role of Documentary

Documentaries, Panh believes, are tools for memory and justice. Michael Renov notes,  
> “The emphasis here is on the replication of the historical real—the creation of a second-order reality cut to the measure of our desire: to cheat death, stop time, restore loss.”  

Ib Bondebjerg adds that documentary forms “become embodied visions and experiences in our minds—in line with experiences from ordinary life.”  

Documentaries don’t just inform; they make audiences feel the emotional and moral weight of history.  

## Preservation and Legacy

To ensure these memories survive, Panh co-founded the **Bophana Audiovisual Resource Center** in Phnom Penh with Ieu Pannakar in 2006. The center preserves film, photography, and sound archives of Cambodia and trains new generations of filmmakers to tell their own stories.  

It mirrors the mission of the **USC Shoah Foundation**, which records survivor testimony from genocides worldwide. Both institutions prove that film and narrative are essential tools for remembrance, empathy, and education.  

Panh said it best:

> “If we don’t try to access and preserve our memory, it means the millions dead will stay only a statistic—with no face, no name, no story. The dead will be nothing.”  

Rithy Panh’s work gives the dead back their stories—and ensures that Cambodia’s collective memory will not fade into silence.
