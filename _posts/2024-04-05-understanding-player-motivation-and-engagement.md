A few weeks ago, I came across some old college papers. One of them looked at how narratives and stereotypes are represented in modern day video games. Reading it, I couldn’t help thinking about my own path, how I ended up at the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) and how our work has quietly shaped the Department of Defense over the years.

Part of that story is how the military has used video games. Over the years, they’ve turned into AI and AR/VR simulations that actually train people for real missions. How people see war really matters—it shapes expectations, readiness, and even recruitment.

I started wondering: how does commercial gaming show war compared to reality? How do ICT’s simulations and games rethink that narrative to enhance military training, readiness, and post-deployment support? How have games actually drawn the next generation into the military?

When I think about games like *Call of Duty* or *Battlefield*, the first things that come to mind are the explosions and dramatic storylines. However, those games almost never show the operational complexity of war: the planning, the logistics, and the real toll it takes on personnel.

Yet, as Matthew Thomas Payne notes in *The Militarization of Video Game Culture*:  
> “Shooter games rarely, if ever, acknowledge the personal costs of war, such as debilitating injuries, mental trauma, and regret. Indeed, games are pleasurable precisely because they transport the player outside the messiness of everyday life. They distill players’ actions into quantifiable scores and in-game achievements.”

For most people, war exists as a high-stakes video game or a cinematic spectacle played out on a screen. But for service members, it’s operational reality. Some lie on beds at night, maintaining situational awareness in uncertain environments, while others are preparing for active deployment, not knowing exactly what’s coming. The gap between commercial gaming and actual operations is substantial, and simulations and realistic training games address that gap directly, giving service members tools to anticipate challenges, make decisions under pressure, and build operational confidence. 

## Strategic Simulations at ICT

Live training is invaluable, but it comes with limits—cost, coordination, and the simple fact that you can’t always recreate every challenge of a real operation. That’s where simulations earn their place. They give teams room to test decisions under pressure, see what happens when variables shift, and practice working across services or agencies without the risk or expense of field drills. What might take months to plan out in reality can play out in a few hours on screen, giving leaders a chance to adjust, repeat, and refine until it feels instinctive.

At ICT, games like *CounterNet*, *Balance of Terror*, and *Dark Networks* immerse players in the roles of state or counterterrorism actors, forcing tough tradeoffs around resources and strategic effectiveness. These games teach critical logistical thinking, decision-making under uncertainty, and adaptive strategy—skills essential in both military and government contexts. All three games are now part of the Global ECCO suite of online games at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) and continue to be used by a broader audience of cyber-security professionals and students. 

ICT’s broader simulation suite pushes the boundaries of training: 

- **Building AI Competencies for All: Becoming Fei** — an educational game for machine learning and data science education funded by DEVCOM Army Research Lab (ARL). It makes AI concepts tangible, helping personnel understand and apply machine learning in real operational settings.  
- **DisasterSim** — places trainees in the shoes of a DoD task force coordinating international disaster relief. Developed with USAID’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and funded by PEO STRI, it strengthens rapid problem-solving in complex, high-stakes conditions.  
- **UrbanSim** — driven by socio-cultural behavior models and story engines based on real commander experiences. It trains situational awareness and adaptive decision-making and has transitioned to the Army under Games for Training and the Low Overhead Training Toolkit.

These simulations accelerate learning, encourage adaptive thinking, and strengthen readiness across joint and interagency operations.

## The Future: Advanced Training Environments

Looking forward, a primary focus is Advanced Training Environments. The military is investing significant resources into advanced head-mounted displays, more dynamic training simulations, and tools for decision-making and drone operations. 

ICT acts as a trusted agent in building and evaluating environments that prepare service members for what’s next, advancing how we think about training, readiness, and rehabilitation.  
For example, ICT’s *Watercraft and Ship Simulator of the Future (WSSOF)*—funded by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)—lets warfighters safely explore complex littoral operations. Future updates aim to expand user interfaces, terrain models, and networking for multi-user simulations that directly enhance operational readiness.  

The MxR Lab’s *Adaptive Head Mounted Display Interfaces (AHMDI)*, funded by the U.S. Army, are intelligent, adaptive user interfaces that adjust in real time based on user inputs and situational contexts. These displays refine 3D data visualization to minimize cognitive overload and increase decision accuracy in the field.

Projects like *Asynchronous Annotation Embedded Environments (A2E2)* point toward a future where military training and operations merge through extended reality. Instead of reviewing static data on screens, trainees move through environments where information is embedded directly into the space around them. This shift strengthens situational awareness and decision-making under real operational tempo.

As Joseph L. Votel notes in *Military Gaming to Stay Ahead, But Not the Kind You Think*:  
> “Unlike traditional military wargaming, which often relies on turn-based exercises with maps or models, the gaming discussed here leverages digital interactive platforms—from modified commercial titles to purpose-built simulations—to emphasize rapid decision-making, high-pressure coordination, and immersive skill development.”

Simulations like these give personnel hands-on practice that can’t be replicated on paper. They help trainees experience decision-making under pressure, build memory for critical responses, and develop confidence that translates directly into the field.

## The Next Frontier: Artificial Intelligence in Training

As simulations become more dynamic, AI connects human performance, data, and decision-making—making training smarter and field operations faster.

A recent memorandum from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated that “the Military Departments should explore the use of artificial intelligence with human oversight,” supporting AI use in IT and administrative processes to streamline operations. In a subsequent Army Transformation and Acquisition Reform memorandum (April 2025), he highlighted the goal to “enable AI-driven command and control at Theater, Corps, and Division headquarters by 2027.”  

Defense leaders across the Joint Staff have echoed these priorities, noting that “as threats evolve, the Joint Staff is integrating AI-driven technologies into daily military operations to enhance commanders’ decision-making and responsiveness.” ICT’s *Becoming Fei* answers this call with a role-playing game that makes AI approachable through immersive learning.

Training with AI also raises new questions: how should AI communicate its limits, and how can users recognize and counter disinformation? Research from ICT’s Human-Centered AI Lab shows that systems which clearly convey their strengths and limitations improve trust and decision-making in high-stakes collaboration.  

These initiatives align with Secretary Hegseth’s priorities: reviving warrior ethos through hands-on training, preparing forces for near-peer and asymmetric threats, and sharpening judgment under pressure. ICT’s work with AR, VR, and AI isn’t just about building tools—it’s about shaping warfighters who can think fast and lead effectively.

In the same way games and films once shaped perceptions of war, ICT now shapes how the military trains for it—turning innovation into readiness and aligning directly with the Department’s vision for a modern, adaptable force.
